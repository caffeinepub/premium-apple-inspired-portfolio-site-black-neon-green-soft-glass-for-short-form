# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Apple-style bubble background theme across the site to a bright green and black palette while keeping content readable.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the current desktop and mobile/portrait site-wide bubble background images with bright green + black variants that retain the glossy Apple-bubble aesthetic.
- Update the hero section floating bubble overlay assets to match the new bright green + black theme while remaining subtle and readable behind text.
- Tune the global background overlay/gradient in CSS as needed to preserve readability in both light and dark modes without washing out the green bubble accents.

**User-visible outcome:** The site loads with a consistent bright green + black Apple-bubble background (desktop and mobile) and matching hero bubble overlays, with text and UI elements remaining readable.
