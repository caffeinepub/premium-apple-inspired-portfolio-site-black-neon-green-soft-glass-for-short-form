  "summary": "The diff implements the requested bright green + black bubble backgrounds (desktop and mobile), updates the hero floating bubble overlays to use the new green/black overlay asset, and adds a dark gradient overlay while preserving fixed/cover background behavior. Some additional global theme tokens and utility classes were also added beyond the stated requirements.",

    {
      "description": "Added/changed broad global design tokens (OKLCH CSS variables) and introduced neon/glass-related utility classes not explicitly requested (e.g., --neon, --neon-glow, .glass-surface, .neon-glow, .neon-text).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on swapping background/overlay imagery and adjusting the global background overlay/gradient for readability; it does not request adding new styling utilities or expanding the design token system.",
