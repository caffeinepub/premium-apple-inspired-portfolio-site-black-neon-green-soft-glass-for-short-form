      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On desktop sizes, the global background (currently set on the `html` element in `frontend/src/index.css`) is visibly darker than before while still showing the neon green lines/bubbles.",
        "On mobile/portrait sizes (the existing `@media (max-width: 768px), (orientation: portrait)` rule), the mobile background is also visibly darker than before.",
        "The background still uses cover, centered positioning, no-repeat, and fixed attachment as it did previously.",
        "Foreground sections and the existing bubble overlay decorations remain visible and are not obscured by the darkening approach (i.e., darkening is applied only to the background rendering)."

Preserve existing behavior (cover, centered position, no-repeat, fixed attachment). Apply the same approach in the existing mobile/portrait media rule while keeping the image asset paths exactly as `/assets/generated/site-background-neon-bubbles.dim_1920x1080.png` and `/assets/generated/site-background-neon-bubbles-mobile.dim_1080x1920.png`."
