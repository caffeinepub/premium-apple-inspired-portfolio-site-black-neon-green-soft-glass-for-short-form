      "id": "REQ-1",
      "text": "Make the site-wide background image render darker so foreground content and the bubble overlay decorations stand out more, by adding a dark overlay/gradient on top of the existing background images for both desktop and mobile/portrait breakpoints (without changing the image filenames or removing the fixed/cover/no-repeat behavior).",
      "target": "frontend",
      "source": {
        "messageIds": [

      },
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On desktop sizes, the global background (currently set on the `html` element in `frontend/src/index.css`) is visibly darker than before while still showing the neon green lines/bubbles.",
        "On mobile/portrait sizes (the existing `@media (max-width: 768px), (orientation: portrait)` rule), the mobile background is also visibly darker than before.",
        "The background still uses cover, centered positioning, no-repeat, and fixed attachment as it did previously.",
        "Foreground sections and the existing bubble overlay decorations remain visible and are not obscured by the darkening approach (i.e., darkening is applied only to the background rendering)."

  "constraints": [
    "Do not modify any files under `frontend/src/components/ui` (read-only).",
    "Do not modify files listed as immutable paths in SYSTEM_CONTEXT (e.g., `frontend/src/main.tsx`, `frontend/src/hooks/useInternetIdentity.ts`, `frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts`).",
    "Keep the existing background image asset paths exactly as they are: `/assets/generated/site-background-neon-bubbles.dim_1920x1080.png` and `/assets/generated/site-background-neon-bubbles-mobile.dim_1080x1920.png`.",
    "No backend changes (Motoko) are needed for this request."

  "nonGoals": [
    "Regenerating or editing the background image assets themselves (apply darkening via CSS instead).",
    "Changing bubble overlay image assets or their positions/opacities unless required to prevent unintended occlusion from the darkening overlay."
